CIFAR-10 Image Classification Project
========================

Welcome to the CIFAR-10 Image Classification Project! This project leverages machine learning to classify images of objects using the CIFAR-10 dataset. 

📚 Libraries Utilized
---------------------

This project makes use of the following libraries:

*   TensorFlow
*   NumPy
*   Matplotlib
*   Keras
*   Python 3.x
  
📂 Data Loading
---------------

The CIFAR-10 dataset is loaded using TensorFlow's built-in functions. The dataset includes 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each with dimensions of 32x32 pixels.

📊 Data Dimensions
------------------

The shapes of the datasets are as follows:

X_train: (50,000, 32, 32, 3)
y_train: (50,000,)
X_test: (10,000, 32, 32, 3)
y_test: (10,000,)

🧠 Neural Network Model
----------------------------------

### 📝 Data Preparation

The images are normalized by scaling pixel values to the range [0, 1].

### 🔧 Model Creation

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is created using Keras. The model architecture includes:

* Convolutional layers
* Max pooling layers
* Fully connected (dense) layers
* Dropout layers for regularization

### 🏋‍♂ Training

The model is trained on the training dataset using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.

### 🔍 Prediction and Evaluation

Predictions are made on the test dataset, and the following evaluation metrics are calculated:

*   *Accuracy
*   *Precision

📈 Results
----------

The CNN model demonstrates good performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset, achieving high accuracy and other metrics.

🔚 Conclusion
-------------

The CNN model provides a robust and efficient method for classifying images in the CIFAR-10 dataset. While the performance is strong, further improvements could be achieved through hyperparameter tuning, using more sophisticated models, or employing data augmentation techniques.

🚀 How to Run
-------------

To install the required libraries, run:

pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
